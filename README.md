The Note Taker App is a simple web application designed for small business owners who need an easy way to write and organize notes. Built with Express.js on the back end, it enables users to create, save, and delete notes, all of which are stored in a JSON file for persistence. The application provides an intuitive interface with existing notes listed in the left-hand column and empty fields for new notes on the right. Users can click on the "Save" icon to save a new note, and the app uniquely assigns each note an ID for proper identification. With a clean and user-friendly design, the Note Taker App streamlines the process of organizing thoughts and tasks.

I've added the appropriate paths and created the server.js file according to the instructions as well as a delete function. I was able to launch on local host but not through Heroku because it was asking for my card information and was charging me money.
